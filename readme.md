Use portalbytes v2 here! https://portalbytes-v2-cor.onrender.com/

## Current additions
aug 5 2025
- serverside config to switch between the corrosion, or alloy proxy backends! (work in progress :3)
aug 1-4 2025
- Replace history state for proxy.html
- 2D **GAME** styled chatroom with custom image

## Issues
- With the implementation of multi proxy backends, the iframe mask page has broken into a loop, will create a substitute until its resolved

## What I want to do
- Frontend/client logic to switch proxy type
- just fun stuff idk
